In this chapter we present the numerical analysis for the Kitaev chain in the one-dimensional Bose gas. In section \ref{sec.onlyNN} we briefly investigate the nearest neighbour hopping only, i.e. $t_2 = 0$. In section \ref{sec.NNNincluded} we include the next-nearest neighbour hopping and study the effect of introducing this parameter. 
 
\section{Only nearest neighbour hopping} \label{sec.onlyNN}
We numerically study the system as a function of two parameters: the coherence length, $\xi$, and the filling fraction $n = N_F/N$. We use the Bose gas parameter $n_Ba_B$ to adjust the coherence length through $\xi \propto (n_Ba_B)^{-1/2}$. We keep the interaction strength, $G$, constant. The phase diagrams are produced in the following manner. For each value of $\xi$ we compute the effective interaction using equation \eqref{eq.gapequation.lattice}. Then for each value of $n$ we come with an initial guess for the pairing. We use $\sin(kd)$, since this is the expected qualitative behaviour. Finally we use equations \eqref{eq.gapequation.lattice} and \eqref{eq.fillingfraction.lattice} to solve for the pairing and chemical potentials in a self-consistent manner for $T = 0$ only. This is done in precisely the same way as in the single and double wire system. This is iterated over $\xi > d$ and $0\leq n \leq 1$. 

The result of the analysis for $G = 4$ and $G = 8$ is shown in figure \ref{fig.phasediagram.t20}. We notice, that the plots are symmetrical around $n = 1/2$ and that a higher interaction strength leads to a narrower window of the topologically nontrivial phase of $\nu = 1$ shown in red. Finally as the coherence length grows, the topological nontrivial phase narrows. We can understand these three effects in the following manner.

First, the symmetry around $n = 1/2$ was discussed in section \ref{sec.fillingfractionsymmetry.breakdown}. Here we showed, that letting $n\to 1 - n$ is a symmetry of the system, if we let $\mu \to -\mu$ and $\Delta_{k}Â \to \Delta_{k + \pi/d}$. The topological invariant is protected under this symmetry for the following two reasons. Firstly, if $\varepsilon_k(\mu) = -t_1\cos(kd) - \mu$ crosses zero, then so does $\varepsilon_k(-\mu)$. Further, the pairing is simply shifted by $\pi / d$. This means, that there is still a contribution of $\text{sgn}(\Delta_{k_1+\pi/d})$ to the invariant from the zero of $\varepsilon_k$ in $k_1$.

Secondly, for a stronger interaction strength, $G$, the window of the topological phase narrows. The reason is, that when there is a nonzero interaction, the band $-t_1\cos(kd)$ can be populated eventhough $\mu$ is below the minimum of the band, i.e. $\mu < -t_1$. For a stronger interaction still, this population starts for lower and lower $\mu$ and there is a larger and larger region, where $\varepsilon_k = -t_1\cos(kd) - \mu$ is strictly positive. This is the topologically trivial region, which hereby becomes larger. The argument for the coherence length follows the same logic.

The effects of higher interaction strength and longer coherence length are the same at $n$ and $1 - n$, because of the filling fraction symmetry. They can be confirmed by studying the dependency $\mu(n)$, e.g. for $G = 0, G = 4$ and $G = 8$. This results in figure \ref{fig.mun.t20.Gdepend}. We clearly observe a nonzero population in the regions with $|\mu| > t_1$ for nonzero interactions, and an increase in the size of these regions with increasing interaction strength. Studying the effect of an increase in $\xi$ confirms, that the effect hereof is essentially the same as increasing the strength, $G$.

There is a topological phase transition exactly at $|\mu| = t_1$. $\nu = 1$ for $|\mu|< t_1$ and $\nu = 0$ for $|\mu| > t_1$. Other parameters: $N = 100, \xi / d = 5.0$}

In this section the program is very similar to the above. Now however, we include the next-nearest neighbour hopping, i.e. $t_2 \neq 0$. We produce two sets of phase diagrams, one for $t_2 = t_1$ and one for $t_2 = 0.63t_1$. For these two values of $t_2$ we do the following. First we search for the same solution as in the above, i.e. the start guess is $\Delta_k \propto \sin(kd)$. This produces the diagrams to the right in figures \ref{fig.phasediagram.t21.0} and \ref{fig.phasediagram.t20.63}. Next we search for a solutions with $\sin(2kd)$-like behaviour. This results in the diagrams to the left. The topological invariant is calculated according to equation \eqref{eq.topologicalinvariant}. We go into more detail with this below. The interesting part of the figures are the blue areas. These show, where it is possible to find a self-consistent solution with a topological invariant $\nu = 2$. It is exactly this sort of solution we are after!  

In figure \ref{fig.Deltaexamples.t21.0} we go into more detail with the pairing at the points $(i)$ and $(ii)$ specified in figure \ref{fig.phasediagram.t21.0}. Remember, that the topological invariant depends on both the kinetic energy, $\varepsilon_k$, and the pairing, $\Delta_k$. Every zero of $\varepsilon_k$ for $k > 0$ contributes the sign of the pairing times the sign of the slope of $\varepsilon_k$:
\begin{equation}
\nu = \left| \text{sgn}\left(\Delta_{k_1}\partial_k\varepsilon_{k = k_1}\right) + \text{sgn}\left(\Delta_{k_1}\partial_k\varepsilon_{k = k_2}\right)\right|, \nonumber
\end{equation}
where $k_1 > 0$ and $k_2 > 0$ denote the two positive zeroes.\footnote{We could also use the negative zeroes. In both cases we can only take the zeroes of the same sign.} Now at $(i)$ we only find one solution for the pairing, irrespective of the initial guess. This single solution is $\sin(kd)$-like in that it only crosses zero at $k = 0$. There is only one positive zero of $\varepsilon_k$, so the invariant is $\nu = 1$. This behaviour is not general for the entire red region of topological invariant $\nu = 1$. Closer to the point $(ii)$, but still in the red region, we indeed find $\sin(2kd)$-like solutions. These however still have $\nu = 1$, because the filling fraction is too low to make an additional pair of zeroes of $\varepsilon_k$. At $(ii)$ we find two solutions for the pairing. Here both a (normal) $\sin(kd)$- and an (anomalous) $\sin(2kd)$-like solution are self-consistent. Since $\varepsilon_k$ now has two pairs of zeroes, the topological invariant is $\nu = 0$ and $\nu = 2$ for the normal and anomalous pairing respectively. This is because the pairing must change sign in-between the zeroes of $\varepsilon_k$ to produce a $\nu = 2$ phase as evident from the above equation and the discussion in the end of chapter \ref{Chapter12}. 

\begin{figure}

Solid blue line: $\sin(2kd)$-like solution with $\nu = 2$. Notice that the pairing is maximal around the zeroes of $\varepsilon_k$.

The occurrence of the anomalous $\nu = 2$ phase is at high filling and high coherence lengths. The former condition we already discussed above. We must have a high filling fraction to produce two pairs of zero points of $\varepsilon_k$. The latter condition we can understand by transforming the pairing to real space. The relevant term in the Hamiltonian has the form $\sum_k \Delta_k c_{-k}c_{k}$. Plugging in $c_k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_j \text{e}^{-ikx_j}x_j$, with $x_j = jd$ we get:
\begin{equation}
\sum_k \Delta_k c_{-k}c_{k} = \sum_{j,l} \tilde{\Delta}_{j,l}c_jc_l, \hspace{0.5cm} \tilde{\Delta}_{j,l} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_k\Delta_k\text{e}^{ik(x_j-x_l)}. \nonumber
\end{equation}
Hence, the real space pairing is quite simply the Fourier transform of the momentum space pairing. We use the orthogonality of $\sin(lkd)$ for different $l$ to get the following. For $\Delta_k = \Delta_1\sin(kd)$ we get $\tilde{\Delta}_{0,1} = -\tilde{\Delta}_{1,0} = -i\frac{\Delta_1}{2}$ with all others zero. In the same manner for $\Delta_k = \Delta_2\sin(2kd)$ we get $\tilde{\Delta}_{0,2} = -\tilde{\Delta}_{2,0} = -i\frac{\Delta_2}{2}$ with all others zero. Spelled out this means, that a $\sin(kd)$-like pairing has dominant \textit{nearest} neighbour pairing, whereas a $\sin(2kd)$-like pairing has dominant \text{next-nearest} neighbour pairing. This explains, why we must go to long coherence lengths. We simply need a long-range interaction for the particles to dominantly be able to pair with next-nearest neighbours. In turn a $\sin(2kd)$-like pairing in momentum space forms and the $\nu = 2$ phase is realized if the filling fraction is large as well, as discussed above. 

Now we can also explain, why the $\nu = 2$ phase region is larger for an increase in $t_2$ as illustrated by the diagrams to the left in figures \ref{fig.phasediagram.t21.0} and \ref{fig.phasediagram.t20.63}. The above analysis shows, that we need a window of two zeroes of the kinetic energy, $\varepsilon_k$. This window is simply larger for increasing $t_2$, since the kinetic energy then bends down more significantly at the Brillouin zone boundary. As $t_2$ decreases, this window narrows, and we observe that the $\nu = 2$ phase completely vanishes. 

The last important feature to study is the total free energy of the system for the different solutions, since the one with minimal free energy will be favourable for the system. The grand energy, $E_0$, is calculated in the same manner as for the double wire using:
\begin{equation}
E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\sum_k \left[\varepsilon_k - E_{F,k} - \Delta_k\braket{c^\dagger_{k}c^\dagger_{-k}}\right] = \frac{1}{2}\sum_k \left[\varepsilon_k - E_{F,k} - \frac{1}{2}|\Delta_k|^2\right], \hspace{0.5cm} T = 0
\label{eq.groundstategrandenergy.sumformula}
\end{equation}
where we use, that $\braket{c_{-k}c_k} = \frac{\Delta_k}{2E_{F,k}}$ for $T = 0$. The free energy is hereby $F = E_0 + \mu N_F$. Since we fix the filling fraction and in turn the number of fermions, it is the free energy, that must be minimal.\footnote{See section \ref{sec.2wiresgrandHFF} for an elaborate argument.}  It would be highly interesting, if the $\nu = 2$ phase could be energetically favourable in some parameter region. We therefore plot the relative difference $(F_2 - F_1)/|F_1|$, where $F_l$ is the free energy when we search for a solution of the form $\Delta_k \sim \sin(lkd)$. Hence, $F_1$ and $F_2$ correspond to the diagrams on the right and left in figure \ref{fig.phasediagram.t21.0} respectively. The result of this analysis for $t_2 = t_1$ is given in figure \ref{fig.energydifference.t21.0}. This explicitly shows, that the $\nu = 2$ phase is \textit{not} energetically favourable. Further, we notice that the higher the filling, the larger the relative difference. However, the figure also shows, that this difference is within $6\%$. This makes it plausible, that one can make the $\nu = 2$ phase favourable through some perturbation of the system. 

The figure has the additional advantage, that it shows us exactly in what region, we find $\Delta_k \sim \sin(2kd)$ solutions. Comparing this with figure \ref{fig.phasediagram.t21.0} we see, that there is a region of the $\nu = 1$ phase, where we find $\sin(2kd)$-like solutions as mentioned above.

A positive value indicates, that the $\sin(kd)$-like solution is energetically favourable. Parameters: $t_2 = t_1$, $G = 4$, $N = 100$. }
