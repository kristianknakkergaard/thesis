In this chapter we present the numerical analysis for the Kitaev chain in the one-dimensional Bose gas. In section \ref{sec.onlyNN} we briefly investigate the nearest neighbour only system, i.e. $t_2 = 0$. In section \ref{sec.NNNincluded} we include the next-nearest neighbour hopping and study the effect of introducing this parameter. 
 
\section{Only nearest neighbour hopping} \label{sec.onlyNN}
We numerically study the system as a function of two parameters: the coherence length, $\xi$, and the filling fraction $n = N_F/N$. We use the Bose gas parameter $n_Ba_B$ to adjust the coherence length through $\xi \propto (n_Ba_B)^{-1/2}$. We keep the interaction strength, $G$, constant. The phase diagrams are produced in the following manner. For each value of $\xi$ we compute the effective interaction using equation \eqref{eq.gapequation.lattice}. Then for each value of $n$ we come with an initial guess for the pairing. We use $\sin(kd)$, since this is the expected qualitative behaviour. Finally we use equations \eqref{eq.gapequation.lattice} and \eqref{eq.fillingfraction.lattice} to solve for the pairing and chemical potentials in a self-consistent manner for $T = 0$ only. This is done in precisely the same way as in the single and double wire system. This is iterated over $\xi > d$ and $0\leq n \leq 1$. 

The result of the analysis for $G = 4$ and $G = 8$ is shown in figure \ref{fig.phasediagram.t20}. We notice, that the plots are symmetrical around $n = 1/2$ and that a higher interaction strength leads to a narrower window of the topologically nontrivial phase of $\nu = 1$ shown in red. Finally as the coherence length grows, the topological nontrivial phase narrows. We can understand these three effects in the following manner.

First, the symmetry around $n = 1/2$ was discussed in section \ref{sec.fillingfractionsymmetry.breakdown}. Here we showed, that letting $n\to 1 - n$ is a symmetry of the system, if we let $\mu \to -\mu$ and $\Delta_{k}Â \to \Delta_{k + \pi/d}$. The topological invariant is protected under this symmetry for the following two reasons. Firstly, if $\varepsilon_k(\mu) = -t_1\cos(kd) - \mu$ crosses zero, then so does $\varepsilon_k(-\mu)$. Further, the pairing is simply shifted by $\pi / d$. This means, that there is still a contribution of $\text{sgn}(\Delta_{k_1+\pi/d})$ to the invariant from the zero of $\varepsilon_k$ in $k_1$.

Secondly, for increasing coherence lengths, $\xi$, the chemical potential must \textit{decrease}. This is because the induced interaction then attracts a larger number of neighbours lowering the total energy $E$, and thereby the chemical potential $\mu = \partial E / \partial N$. For a fixed filling fraction this eventually leads to a completely positive $\varepsilon_k = -t_1\cos(kd) - \mu$. Hereby there are no zero-points, and the invariant is zero. 

Thirdly, for a stronger interaction strength, $G$, the window of the topological phase narrows. The reason is, that when there is a nonzero interaction, the band $-t_1\cos(kd)$ can be populated eventhough $\mu$ is below the minimum of the band, i.e. $\mu < -t_1$. For a stronger interaction still, this population starts for lower and lower $\mu$ and there is a larger and larger region, where $\varepsilon_k = -t_1\cos(kd) - \mu$ is strictly positive.

The two latter effects are the same at $n$ and $1 - n$, because of the filling fraction symmetry. They can be confirmed by studying the dependency $\mu(n)$, e.g. for $G = 0, G = 4$ and $G = 8$. This results in figure \ref{fig.mun.t20.Gdepend}. We clearly observe a nonzero population in the regions with $|\mu| > t_1$ for nonzero interactions, and an increase in the size of these regions with increasing interaction strength.

We notice, that for nonzero interaction strengths the lattice starts populating for $|\mu| > t_1$. There is a topological phase transition exactly at $|\mu| = t_1$. $\nu = 1$ for $|\mu|< t_1$ and $\nu = 0$ for $|\mu| > t_1$. Other parameters: $N = 100, \xi / d = 8.0$}

\section{Next-nearest neighbour hopping included}
\label{sec.NNNincluded} 
In this section the program is very similar to the above. Now however, we include the next-nearest neighbour hopping, i.e. $t_2 \neq 0$. We produce two sets of phase diagrams, one for $t_2 = t_1$ and one for $t_2 = 0.63t_1$. For these two values of $t_2$ we do the following. First we search for the same solution as in the above, i.e. the start guess is $\Delta_k \propto \sin(kd)$. This produces the diagrams to the right in figures \ref{fig.phasediagram.t21.0} and \ref{fig.phasediagram.t20.63}. Next we search for a solutions with $\sin(2kd)$-like behaviour. This results in the diagrams to the left. The topological invariant is calculated according to equation \eqref{eq.topologicalinvariant}. We go into more detail with this below. The interesting part of the figures are the blue areas. These show, where it is possible to find a self-consistent solution with a topological invariant $\nu = 2$. It is exactly this sort of solution we are after!

To the right: (normal) result of searching for $\Delta_k \propto \sin(kd)$-like solutions. The algorithm is a little uncertain around the blue tip at $n \approx 0.4, \xi / d \approx 2$. The phase has here been checked by doubling the number of lattice sites. Other parameters: $G = 4$, $N = 100$. }

In figure \ref{fig.Deltaexamples.t21.0} we go into more detail with the pairing at the points $(i)$ and $(ii)$ specified in figure \ref{fig.phasediagram.t21.0}. Remember, that the topological invariant depends on both the kinetic energy, $\varepsilon_k$, and the pairing, $\Delta_k$. Every zero of $\varepsilon_k$ for $k > 0$ contributes the sign of the pairing times the sign of the slope of $\varepsilon_k$. 

 At $(i)$ we only find one solution for the pairing, irrespective of the initial guess. This single solution is $\sin(kd)$-like in that it only crosses zero at $k = 0$. 




However, this is not the case in the entire red region of topological invariant $\nu = 1$. Closer to the point $(ii)$, but still in the red region, we indeed find $\sin(2kd)$-like solutions. These however still have $\nu = 1$, because the filling fraction is too low to make an additional pair of zeroes of $\varepsilon_k$. At $(ii)$ we find two solutions for the pairing. Here both a (normal) $\sin(kd)$- and an (anomalous) $\sin(2kd)$-like solution are self-consistent. Since $\varepsilon_k$ now has two pairs of zeroes, the topological invariant is $\nu = 0$ and $\nu = 2$ for the normal and anomalous pairing respectively.
