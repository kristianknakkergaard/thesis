In this chapter we present the numerical analysis and results of the two wire system. The most noticeable of the results is, that we are able to find an interval of interwire distances, where both $s$- and $p$-wave type pairings exist, and that this is the energetically favourable state of the system.

\section{Cross over region and energy considerations}
In this section we will show numerically, that during the transition from interwire to intrawire pairing the energetically favourable state of the system is the one where the interwire pairing is purely imaginary. We will further show, that this transition is characterized by having both the interwire and intrawire pairing simultaneously nonzero over an interval of interwire distances, $d$. 

We first come with an energy analysis as described after equation \eqref{eq.2wiresGrandGroundStateEnergy}. Let us first calculate the free energy, when the two wires are just free fermion gases. For $T = 0$ the free energy is simply the sum of the kinetic energy $\frac{k^2}{2m_F}$ for $|k| < k_F$: 
\begin{equation}
F = 2\sum_{k, |k| < k_F} \frac{k^2}{2m_F} = \frac{\mathcal{L}}{\pi} \int^{k_F}_{-k_F} dk \frac{k^2}{2m_F} = \epsilon_{F,0} N_F \int^{1}_{-1} d\tilde{k}\; \tilde{k}^2 = \frac{2}{3}\epsilon_{F,0} N_F. 
\end{equation}
This gives rise to the solid black curve in figure \ref{fig.2wiresE0ddepend}. 

Now the numerical analysis. Common for all the analyses we do the following. We start at low values of $d$. First, we come with an initial guess for the pairings and the chemical potential. Second, the pairings and chemical potentials are inserting in the gap equations \ref{eq.2wiresgapequations} and an updated version of the pairings is obtained. Third, this is inserted into the number equation \ref{eq.2wiresnumberequation}, which gives an updated version of the chemical potential. Finally, this is iterated until the pairings are not altered by more than $0.1$\textperthousand. For each step of $d$ we then return to the same initial guess for the pairings to avoid any hysteresis in the analysis. We then use equation \eqref{eq.2wiresGrandGroundStateEnergy} to calculate the grand energy, $E_0$, and in turn the Helmholtz free energy $E_0 + 2\mu N_F$.  

If we let $\Delta^{12}_k = 0$ and search for nonzero $\Delta^{11}_k$ we get the dashed curve in figure \ref{fig.2wiresE0ddepend} for the specified set of parameters. Hence, this describes the situation where we only have intrawire pairing. It is independent of $d$ as it should be. Conversely, we can let $\Delta^{11}_k = 0 = \Delta^{22}_k$ and search for nonzero $\Delta^{12}_k$. This results in the dash-dotted curve. As we expect, these two curves intersect at some critical distance $d_c$. In the present case $k_Fd_c \approx 0.748$. The naively expected behaviour is then the following. For large distances, $d$, the intrawire pairing is energetically favourable and is therefore the only one present. As we decrease $d$ we get to the critical point $d_c$, where the interwire pairing becomes favourable in stead. For $d < d_c$ we would then naively expect, the interwire pairing to be the only one present. This turns out to be the exact behaviour, if we force the interwire pairing to be real. The two types of pairings do not coexist, a sudden flip from one to the other occures. This is the blue curve in figure \ref{fig.2wiresE0ddepend}. 

The question now is: can we find a solution, where both pairings are present simultaneously and is this energetically favourable? The answer is the following. If we let $\Delta^{12}_k$ be purely imaginary and search for both nonzero $\Delta^{12}_k$ and $\Delta^{11}_k$, we get the red curve. This curve clearly represents the energetically favourable solution. Since the sudden flip between the two types of pairings is associated with the blue curve, the red curve must describe a coexistence of the two types of pairings. This we verify explicitly in the following analysis. 

We concentrate on the energetically favourable solution: $\Delta^{12}_k$ imaginary. In this case the energy dispersions are identical and even in $k$: $E^{\pm}_{F,k} = E_{F,k} = \sqrt{\varepsilon_k^2 + (\Delta^{11}_k)^2 + |\Delta^{12}_k|^2}$. This means, that the gap equations in \eqref{eq.2wiresgapequations} partially decouples: 
\begin{align}
\Delta^{11}_k &= -\frac{1}{\mathcal{L}}\sum_{k'} W^\text{ind}_{FF,11}(k, k')\frac{\Delta^{11}_{k'}}{2E_{F,k'}}\tanh\left(\frac{\beta E_{F,k'}}{2}\right), \nonumber \\
\Delta^{12}_k &= -\frac{1}{\mathcal{L}}\sum_{k'} W^\text{ind}_{FF,12}(k, k')\frac{\Delta^{12}_{k'}}{2E_{F,k'}}\tanh\left(\frac{\beta E_{F,k'}}{2}\right).
\label{eq.2wiresgapequationsDelta12imaginary}
\end{align} 
This explicitly shows, that the two pairings are only coupled through the energy $E_{F,k}$. We start the analysis around $d = d_c$, since both pairings are suspected to be present there. For each value of $d$ we do something very similar to the above. However, here we do not reinitiate the initial guess in each step of $d$. In stead we reuse the found solution from the previous value of $d$. This makes the analysis much faster, and as long as the transition between the pairings is continuous no mistake is made. Further, we record the maximal values $\max_k\left[\left|\Delta^{11}_k\right|\right]$ and $\max_k\left[\left|\Delta^{12}_k\right|\right]$. The result is shown in figure \ref{fig.2wiresMaximalPairingddepend}.

\label{fig.2wiresMaximalPairingddepend}  
\end{center}    
\end{figure}
 
We see, that for small and large distances the expected behaviour is observed. Naively it seems to be the case, that the interwire pairing increases linearly for small $k_Fd$. However, an analysis to lower values of $d$ shows, that it diverges for $d \to 0$ as expected. In between we see a continuous cross over region, where both pairings are present. Further, we notice that the intrawire pairing is constant from just under $k_Fd = 0.78$ and upwards as we expected. The fact that we start at $k_Fd = k_Fd_c = 0.748$, and then iterate downwards and upwards from there is the reason for the very small indent in the data precisely at this value.

The figure only shows the maximal pairing $\max_k[|\Delta_k|]$. The same analysis also gives us, how the pairings functionally change as the distance $d$ is varied. This is summarized in figure \ref{fig.pairingkdependT0dvaried}. This explicitly shows, that the interwire pairing is even in $k$ and hence is a $s$-wave type pairing. We see, that it has its maximum value at $k=0$ as one might expect from the interwire induced interaction. Further, it shows no oscillatory behaviour, it simply decays exponentially for large values of $k$. The intrawire pairing is seen to have the same functional form as for the single wire, hence a $p$-wave type pairing. The overall behaviour of the pairings are seen to be independent of $d$. The interwire pairing is simply enhanced as $d$ decreases, vice versa for the intrawire pairing.  

\begin{figure}

\input{Figures/twowires/Deltas1/kdepend.tex}  
\caption{The pairings $\Delta^{11}_k$ (odd) and $\Delta^{12}_k$ (even) plotted as a function of $k$. We see, that the functional behaviour is independent of $d$, and that there is a cross over between interwire and intrawire dominated pairing. The intrawire pairing is increased as $d$ increases. Vice versa for the interwire pairing. Parameters: $(n_Ba_B^3)^{1/3} = 0.01$, $(n_Ba_{BF}^3)^{1/3} = 0.11$, $l_t = 0$, $\frac{m_B}{m_F} = 7/40$, $\frac{n_F}{n_B^{1/3}} = 0.215$, $v_F/c_0 = 0.33$. }  
\label{fig.pairingkdependT0dvaried}  
\end{center}    
\end{figure}

The combined result of the three figures tells us the following. We are able to find a cross over region of interwire distances $d$, where both an interwire $s$-wave pairing and an intrawire $p$-wave pairing is present, and this transition is the energetically favourable. 

\section{Range of interaction dependency of cross over}
In this section we will investigate how the cross over from intrawire to interwire pairing depends on the range of the induced interaction. The range is roughly the condensate coherence length $\xi$:
\begin{equation}
k_F\frac{\xi}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{4}\frac{1}{\sqrt{(n_Ba_B^3)^{1/3}}}\frac{n_F}{n_B^{1/3}}.
\label{eq.RangefunctionofrBBnB}
\end{equation}
It is intuitively reasonable, that for a longer interaction range, the interwire interaction will become comparable to the intrawire interaction at a larger critical distance $d_c$ between the wires. This is simply because the distance between the wires should become less significant for a longer interaction range. Hence, we expect a monotonic increase of $d_c$ with $\xi$.   

For the analysis, we will keep the Bose gas parameter $(n_Ba_B^3)^{1/3}$ constant and use the ratio of interparticle distances $n_F/n_B^{1/3}$ to vary the range of the interaction. The analysis is then performed in the following way. We start at a high value of $n_F/n_B^{1/3}$. A direct and precise measure for the transition is the previously mentioned critical distance $d_c$. In practice this is found in the following way. First we calculate the free energy $F_1(\Delta^{11}_k) = E_0(\Delta^{11}_k) + 2 \mu (\Delta^{11}_k) N_F$ in the case, that there is only intrawire pairing, $\Delta^{11}_k$ present. This is independent of $d$ as described by the dashed curve in figure \ref{fig.2wiresE0ddepend}. Then we calculate the same in the case, there is only interwire pairing, $\Delta^{12}_k$, present. We then iteratively find the value of $d = d_c$, where the free energies match: $F(\Delta^{12}_k, d_c) = F(\Delta^{11}_k)$. We then decrease $n_F/n_B^{1/3}$ by a small amount and repeat the process. The outcome of the analysis is shown in figure \ref{fig.twowirescrossovernBdepend}. We notice, that the $d_c$ exhibits a maximal value, and that it approaches a constant for large ratios of $n_F/n_B^{1/3}$. The red line indicates where $v_F = c_0$. Therefore, the behaviour to the right of the red line can only be considered as the zero frequency contribution. Hence, strictly we can only describe the effect of the zero frequency component. 

We can understand the appearance of the asymptotic behaviour from a functional point of view. The intrawire pairing, $\Delta^{11}_k$, depends on the parameters $\beta, m_B/m_F, (n_Ba_B^3)^{1/3}$ and $n_B^{1/3}/n_F$ and is a functional of the pairings themselves: $\Delta^{11}_k, \Delta^{12}_k$. This is similarly the case for the interwire pairing, $\Delta^{12}_k$, with the additional parameter $d$. Hence, we can write:
\begin{equation}
\Delta^{11}_k = F\left(\Delta^{11}_k, \Delta^{12}_k, \beta, \frac{m_B}{m_F}, (n_Ba_B^3)^{1/3}, \frac{n_B^{1/3}}{n_F} \right), \hspace{0.5cm} \Delta^{12}_k = G\left(\Delta^{11}_k, \Delta^{12}_k, \beta, \frac{m_B}{m_F}, (n_Ba_B^3)^{1/3}, \frac{n_B^{1/3}}{n_F}, d \right), \nonumber 
\end{equation}
where $F$ and $G$ are the described functionals. On unitless form the functionals have a common prefactor, that depends on the mass ratio, the Bose gas parameter and the ratio of interparticle distances: $m_B/m_F, (n_Ba_B^3)^{1/3}$, and $n_B^{1/3}/n_F$. This means, that the limit of $n_F/n_B^{1/3} \to \infty $ is well-defined for the ratio of the pairings:
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\frac{n_F}{n_B^{1/3}} \to \infty} \left[\frac{\max_k[|\Delta^{11}_k|]}{\max_k[|\Delta^{12}_k|]}\right] = \frac{\max_k\left[\left|F\left(\Delta^{11}_k, \Delta^{12}_k, \beta, \frac{m_B}{m_F}, (n_Ba_B^3)^{1/3}, \frac{n_B^{1/3}}{n_F} = 0 \right)\right|\right] }{\max_k\left[\left|G\left(\Delta^{11}_k, \Delta^{12}_k, \beta, \frac{m_B}{m_F}, (n_Ba_B^3)^{1/3}, \frac{n_B^{1/3}}{n_F} = 0, d \right)\right|\right]}. \nonumber
\end{equation}
Since the pairings must be comparable at a distance similar to $d_c$, the above ratio will be equal to 1 at a distance similar to $d_c$. It is therefore evident that $d_c$ is independent of the ratio of interparticle distances for $n_F/n_B^{1/3} \gg 1$. Hence, $d_c$ must approach a constant for increasing values of $n_F/n_B^{1/3}$. From equation \eqref{eq.RangefunctionofrBBnB} it is clear, that an increase in $n_F/n_B^{1/3}$ for a fixed Bose gas parameter $(n_Ba_B^3)^{1/3}$ gives an increase in the coherence length $k_F\xi$ and hence in the range of the interactions. Therefore, the behaviour described in this section is \textit{not} in agreement with the intuitive idea given in the end of chapter \ref{Chapter8}, that the interwire interaction will become significant at a distance around the range of the interaction!

\begin{figure} 
\begin{center}  
\input{Figures/twowires/Deltas3.1.2/nBdepend.tex}  
\caption{The critical distance $d_c$ plotted as a function of the ratio of interparticle distances $n_F/n_B^{1/3}$. Notice, that there is a maximum, at that $d_c$ approaches a constant for large $n_F/n_B^{1/3}$. The red line indicates, where $v_F = c_0$. The curve to the right hereof is only the zero frequency contribution. Parameters: $(n_Ba_B^3)^{1/3} = 0.01$, $(n_Ba_{BF}^3)^{1/3} = 0.11$, $l_t = 0$, $\frac{m_B}{m_F} = 7/40$. }  
\label{fig.twowirescrossovernBdepend}  
\end{center}    
\end{figure}

The appearance of a maximum in $d_c$ can qualitatively be understood in the following way. For low values of $n_F/n_B^{1/3}$ the Bose gas becomes more rigid, since the spacing between the bosons becomes smaller. Hence, the wires must be brought closer together for the interwire pairing to dominate. For high values of $n_F/n_B^{1/3}$ the Bose gas is depleted. This means, that there are simply fewer bosons for the fermions to interact with. It is therefore reasonable, that $d_c$ should not exhibit a maximal value for $n_F/n_B^{1/3} \to \infty$. As a consequence a maximal value of $d_c$ appeares. This analysis is reminiscent of the analysis explaning the appearance of a minimum in $W^\text{ind}_{FF,12}(k_F,k_F)$ as a function of $n_F/n_B^{1/3}$. See subsection \ref{subsec.relevantmomenta.effectiveinteraction} for the details.  

The result of this section is experimentally relevant. In a real experiment one might speculate in controlling the felt distance between the wires by tuning the coherence length. This may be an easier task, than physically moving the wires, since one here as to adjust the traps. However, the analysis in this section shows, that this cannot be done, at least not through putting more bosons into the gas. Why? - because one would then need the critical distance $d_c \to \infty$ for $n_F/n_B^{1/3} \to \infty$. In contradiction with the results of this section. The only possibility left is to adjust the Bose gas parameter $(n_Ba_B^3)^{1/3}$.

\section{Temperature dependency of pairings}
In this section we will investigate, how the pairings depend on temperature. The analysis is performed in complete analogy to the one in subsection \ref{subsec.momentum_and_temperature_pairing_singlewire}. 

For small and large distances, where one of the pairings is dominant, it is not difficult to imagine, what will happen. Here we expect, that the two pairings go to zero in a similar manner to single wire at two different critical temperatures. The dominant pairing for $T = 0$ will have the highest critical temperature. However, a couple questions arise. How does it affect the dominant pairing, that the suppressed pairing goes to zero? And is the interwire or intrawire pairing the more robust to a rise in temperature?

To answer these questions we investigate three cases, two where one pairing is strongly dominant, and one where the pairings are essentially equal for $T = 0$. The more interesting case is definitely the latter one, since this directly tests what pairing is the more robust. However, we might also gain some insight from the former. 

The result of the analysis for a dominant interwire pairing is shown in figure \ref{fig.maximalpairingsTdepend_2wires}. We see, that the overall expected behaviour is observed. We observe that the interwire pairing has a small kink, where the intrawire pairing vanishes. This emphasizes, that one pairing influences the functional behaviour of the other. Further, above this first critical temperature the maximal interwire pairing is astonishingly well described by the following relation:
\begin{equation}
\max_k[\Delta^{12}_k(T)] = \alpha \max_k[\Delta^{12}_k(T = 0)] \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{T}{T_c}\right)^3}. 
\end{equation}
The coefficient $\alpha$ is close to $1$, but seems to depend slightly on the other parameters of the problem. For the present set of parameters we have $\alpha = 1.075$. This functional behaviour is the same as the single wire asymptotic form of the intrawire pairing apart from the $\alpha$ coefficient. Also, the agreement between the actual behaviour of the pairing and the asymptotic form kicks in earlier and to a higher degree in the present case.
