This thesis is a study of how one can realise a topological superfluid in mixtures of fermions and bosons. Specifically, we theoretically investigate fermion wires immersed in a sea of bosons, a 1D-3D Fermi-Bose mixture. We investigate how a point interaction between the fermions and bosons induce an attractive interaction between the fermions themselves. For a single wire, using a mean field approach in a weak coupling limit, this leads to the realisation of the Kitaev model for spinless $p$-wave superfluids. The system is characterized by having a topological phase as its ground state. Next we study a system with two parallel fermion wires. Here the interwire distance becomes a parameter with which we can control whether the interaction internally in each wire or between the wires is dominant. This makes it possible to study a $p$- to $s$-wave phase transition. The question is whether this transition is topological or not. 

The study of topological phases of matter is in a thriving development, being one of the biggest research areas of modern condensed matter physics and receiving the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics \cite{NobelPrize2016}. The reason for this development is in part, that topological phases of matter gives a whole new perspective on condensed matter physics, revealing up to now unknown phases of matter. Therefore, it is of high interest to realise simple yet tunable topological phases of matter. The specific 1D-3D Fermi-Bose mixture is in this sense a well suited candidate for investigation due to its high degree of tunability. 

We emphasize, that the mean field approach used throughout the thesis is problematic for the one-dimensional wires due to the Mermin-Wagner theorem \cite{Hohenberg.MerminWagnertheorem}. The reason for using this approach then hinges on the following. First, the topological classification called the tenfold way is developed for band Hamiltonians \cite{Ryu.Topology}. This is the only classification scheme, that is fully developed. Second, the mean field approach is by far the simpler approximation method for a macroscopic number of particles. Third, the induced interaction between the fermions is in a sense long range. The Mermin-Wagner theorem may therefore be invalid in the present context \cite{Ortiz.Beyondmeanfieldtheory}. We return to this issue in chapter \ref{Chapter4}. 

\newpage
The thesis is organised in the following way. In chapter \ref{Chapter2} we come with a short summary of the most important ingredients of condensed matter physics for understanding the system at hand. In part II, chapters \ref{Chapter3} through \ref{Chapter7}, we investigate the \textit{single} fermion wire system. The focus is on the bulk properties of the system, specifically how the superfluidity of the fermion wire responds to changes in the system variables. This is primarily done through numerical analyses. In chapter \ref{Chapter7} we also briefly investigate the Majorana edge states. In part III, chapters \ref{Chapter8} through \ref{Chapter11}, we investigate a two wire system of two parallel fermion wires. Here we will find, that there are two types of superfluidity appearing, both $p$- and $s$-wave. We will focus on how we can control the appearance of these by adjusting the distance between the wires. This neatly links to the underlying topological theory. In particular we will investigate how the topology of the system influences the transition between $p$- and $s$-wave superfluidity and how it influences the presence of Majorana edge states.
