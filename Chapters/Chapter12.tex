\section{Physical interpretation of cross over in double wire system} \label{sec.Discussion.2wires.crossover}


\section{Physical discrepancies, self-energy and mean field theory} \label{sec.Discussion.physicaldiscrepancies}
Consider the gap equations for the double wire system, equation \eqref{eq.2wiresgapequations}. As we bring the wires closer together the intrawire pairing is not affected by the interwire induced interaction until an interwire pairing forms. This is absurd. The interwire interaction will of course alter the physical properties internally in each wire, also when the wires are far apart. This also leads to the odd prediction, that the critical temperature for intrawire pairing is unaffected by the interwire interaction, as long as the interwire pairing is absent. This is \textit{not} physically reasonable. 

What we have ignored in the analysis is the socalled self-energy. The self-energy is the energy shift a fermion experiences due to its interaction with all the others. It is clear, that this self-energy will increase as the wires are brought closer together. This is treatable within mean field theory, and so it is possible to account for this physical discrepancy within the establishes framework. 

\section{Kitaev chain} \label{sec.Discussion.KitaevChain}
In this thesis we have studied fermionic one dimensional \textit{gasses}. The original work of Kitaev is based on fermions sitting in a one-dimensional \textit{lattice} with nearest-neighbour hopping and pairing \cite{KitaevQuantumWires}. In recent work by Alecce and Dell'Anna an extended version of the Kitaev chain with $r$ neighbours is considered \cite{Alecce.extendKitaev}. They find, that if the hopping and pairing decays sufficiently slow, topological phases with up to $r$ Majorana edge states can be found, hence exceeding the Kitaev result of a single Majorana edge state. In this connection we have briefly studied, whether this is possible in our 1D-3D Fermi-Bose mixture. More specifically we think of the fermions as sitting in an optical lattice with nearest and next nearest neighbour hopping. We must then self-consistently solve for the pairing, $\Delta_k$, and compute the $\mathbb{Z}$-topological invariant $\nu = 2\text{CS}_1$. In this we therefore search for $\nu = \pm 2$. Unfortunately, we have not been able to find such a solution. We speculate, that the reason for this is, that the Yukawa interaction is simply not long range enough. This is supported by the fact, that we can find $\nu = \pm 2$ solutions, when the interaction drops of as $|x|^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha < 1$. This is also consistent with the findings of Alecce and Dell'Anna. Specifically, they show that the hopping and pairing both have to decay with $\alpha < 1$ for the number of Majorana edge states to exceed 1.
