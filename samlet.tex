In this thesis we theoretically investigate the properties of 1D-3D Fermi-Bose mixtures. Specifically, we embed one dimensional wires of gas constituted by identical fermions in a three dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate constituted by identical bosons. The fermions and bosons are assumed to interact through a point interaction. The surrounding condensate hereby induces an attractive interaction between the fermions. As a result the fermions form a superfluid. The single wire system is then studied in a weak coupling limit in a mean field approach. This produces a self-consistency equation for the resulting $p$-wave pairing, which we solve for numerically. The system realises the Kitaev model of $p$-wave pairing, which we show to have a topological ground state by computing the topological index. As a result edge states form at the end of the wires. 

The double wire system of parallel fermion wires is then studied in a similar manner. The \textit{intra}wire interaction again forms $p$-wave pairing. The additional \textit{inter}wire interaction is between distinguishable fermions. As a result a competing $s$-wave pairing forms. The transition from $p$- to $s$-wave for decreasing interwire distances is studied in terms of the symmetries and topology of the system. This analysis is compared to a numerical calculation of the pairings. The form of the transition is seen to depend on the phase of the interwire $s$-wave pairing. We show, that the energetically favourable transition exhibits a coexistence of $p$- and $s$-wave pairing. This transition is nontopological, eventhough it is between a topological and trivial phase. 

Finally, we study an extension of the Kitaev chain in a 1D Bose gas. We show, that there are two possible topological phases; one with a single edge state, one with two.

The thesis is organised in the following way. Part I is introductory. We motivate the present work and come with a short summary of the most important ingredients of condensed matter physics for understanding the system at hand. In part II, chapters \ref{Chapter3} through \ref{Chapter7}, we investigate the single fermion wire system. In part III, chapters \ref{Chapter8} through \ref{Chapter11}, we investigate a two wire system of parallel wires. Finally, in part IV we discuss the main results and come with our conclusions. 

I would like to thank my supervisor, associate professor Georg Bruun, for his guidance and faith in me as a student. Throughout our collaboration he has been nothing but inspiring, enthusiastic and supportive. Further, I would like to thank phD student Jonatan Midtgaard for many frustrating but also interesting and illuminating discussions about the systems we both study. Also, I would like to thank postdoc Zhigang Wu for his comments and thoughts, especially on the one-dimensional Bose gas. Finally, I would like to thank my love, Nana, for being ever so patient and interested.

\part{Kitaev wires}
In this second part we analyse the double wire system. The physical setup is the following. A uniform three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate is formed using a gas of cooled bosonic atoms. The main example of the thesis will be $^{7}\text{Li}$, which is bosonic due to the \textit{even} number of constituent fermions. Embedded in this three-dimensional BEC, fermionic atoms on two one-dimensional wires is trapped. The main example will be $^{40}\text{K}$, which is fermionic since it is constituted by an \textit{odd} number of fermions. We will \textit{not} be going into details with the atomic structures or the mechanism of the trapping methods, since we wish to keep the discussion quite general. The intrawire and interwire interactions leads to $p$- and $s$-wave pairing respectively. The goal is hereby to study the $p$- to $s$-wave phase transition as the wires are brought closer together. The system is pictorially depicted in the below figure.

\part{Kitaev chain and winding numbers larger than 1}
In this third part we study an extended version of the Kitaev chain. The fermions are arranged along a single wire in a lattice. We further assume, that the fermions both have significant nearest and next-nearest hopping. The Bose gas is now one-dimensional, because we expect that we can make the induced interaction longer range in this way. The motivation for studying this system is the following. In a recent article Alecce and Dell'Anna show, that in superfluid systems with both hopping and pairing to several neighbours, it is possible to get winding numbers larger than 1 \cite{Alecce.extendKitaev}. In turn several edge states at the ends of the chain emerge. We suspect, that we can achieve longer range hopping by increasing the range of the interaction. Hence, this system is a proposal of how to actually construct such a system.
